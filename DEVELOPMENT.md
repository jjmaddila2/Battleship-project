Started my project.
Did a general overview on java so I got a better understanding of how to start the code
Now that I am done with that I will start on the actuall c++ code
Will use a library to create functionality with buttons cause that would be helpful.
Started with the c++ code got a little done and created some functionality but still needs a lot of work. Just got some of the basic player, ship and board classes. This week I will continue working AI and make sure the evaulation goes. But will also have to start creating tests and start graphic before next week.
The library I'm using is simply the GUI library that is avilable through openFrameworks.
