Started my project.
Did a general overview on java so I got a better understanding of how to start the code
Now that I am done with that I will start on the actuall c++ code
Will use a library to create functionality with buttons cause that would be helpful.
Started with the c++ code got a little done and created some functionality but still needs a lot of work
