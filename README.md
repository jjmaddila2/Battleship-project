# CS 126 FinalProject
To play that game when you start make sure you press the direction you want to place the ship and then press the location on the board you want to play on. If you do the location first you will run into an error. After you place your 5 ships than you can press the board without the direction to choose where you want to fire on the AI. You can press either board you want but the output will either come on the left or right board. Make sure to play with sound as the game does have music and sound effects. Make sure you do not include the test file with the actual game files since catch has a main and there is a main in my game so you will run into an error.

To build the game itself all you have to do is open the code in visual studio and press the play button and the code should work.
