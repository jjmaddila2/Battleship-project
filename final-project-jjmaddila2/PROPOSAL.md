# Project Proposal

For my project I was planning on creating the game battleship on c++. I feel like this would be a good game to make because
it can properly utilize openframeworks as graphics will only make the game better. Also, I think this game would be
a fun, interesting game to create, as it is a classic game that can be reinvented and customized in many ways to make the game
specific for a person, and how they would want to play.

In terms of actual customizable features, I was thinking of creating a style where you can pick the dimensions of the board
along with how many ships you want to play with along with the length of all of these ships. Also, if possible I think it would
awesome to create an AI, so a person can play the computer. But, I will also make sure to also include a two-player mode. In this
case I will include a way so that player 1 and player 2's board are not visible at the same time, in order to make the game playable.

For the external external libraries that I will use, I will mostly be using the map and vector libraries, but I will make sure to use
more libraries that we have not learned. Mostly if I utilize graphics I will need to use that library. If I do not use libraries
the instead use something like a list or an array, or an bit array in terms of defining the ships themselves and making
the game easier to manage and to make.
